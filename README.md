### Why I Love Front-End Development
Because let’s be honest, who doesn’t want to build the future... one pixel at a time? 😜
Just messing, but really, that's the dream!

I’ve been a technology enthusiast since I was a kid, always in awe of what code can do. What started as a hobby — tinkering with new tools and creating random projects — has now turned into a full-blown career. React is my weapon of choice (I swear it has superpowers), and I’m constantly staying on top of the latest trends and updates in the React ecosystem.

As a Front-End Developer, I focus on building web apps that aren’t just functional but also fun to use. My go-to stack includes **React.js**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Styled-Components** (because who doesn’t love a good-looking app?). I also use **Redux** for managing state and **Axios** to keep my API calls smooth and painless.

I’m always learning — whether it's expanding my front-end and back-end skills, or diving into mobile development with **React Native** (because why stop at web?). The future is exciting, and I’m all in.
