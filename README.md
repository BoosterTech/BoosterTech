### Why I Love Front-End Development

I’ve been a technology enthusiast since I was a child, fascinated by what code can accomplish. Initially, coding was a hobby where I could explore new tools, and it quickly grew into a career. React has become my tool of choice, and I’m constantly striving to stay up-to-date with new trends and advancements in the React ecosystem.

As a Front-End Developer, I focus on building web apps that are both functional and intuitive. My primary stack includes **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**, with **Tailwind CSS** and **Styled-Components** for styling. I also leverage **Redux** for state management and **Axios** for seamless API interactions.

I'm continuously learning, working on both **front-end** and **back-end** technologies, and expanding my skills into **mobile development** with **React Native**.
